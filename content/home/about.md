# Welcome!

I am Zachary Rodriguez, a PhD candidate studying evolutionary biology at Louisiana State University ([LSU](http://www.lsu.edu/)).  I’m a denizen of LSU’s [Museum of Natural Science](http://www.lsu.edu/mns/), working with Dr. Christopher Austin (curator of Reptiles and Amphibians) . I'm super excited for the research & outreach opportunities available at the museum and created this website to share my interests and experiences with you! Feel free to look around and shoot me an email if you have any questions.

# Research Interests

I am broadly interested in the natural history of reptiles and amphibians, phylogenetics, and genomics.  My dissertation research investigates the phylogenetic and genomic history of complex traits in lizards. I ultimately want to shed light on how genome evolution drives and maintains the biological diversity we see today. Check out my Research page to learn more!
